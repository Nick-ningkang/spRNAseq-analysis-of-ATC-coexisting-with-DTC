Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of ATC Coexisting with DTC
This repository contains the analysis code for our spatial transcriptomic (spRNA-seq) study investigating anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) coexisting with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).

🔬 Project Overview
In this study, we performed spatial transcriptomics on human thyroid tumor samples exhibiting both ATC and DTC components. The goal was to delineate spatial gene expression patterns and uncover molecular mechanisms underlying tumor dedifferentiation.
